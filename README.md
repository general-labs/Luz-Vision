# Luz-Vision
## A world made with words for those visually impaired or blind. 

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Assistive Technology.

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to see how technology can redefine the limitation or boundary of visually impaired or blind. It's a baby step to integrate AI into assistive technology. The ultimate goals is to make a small tiny device that can act as a virtual assistant using AI.

##### Option 1: Web RTC + AI ([DEMO](https://youtu.be/JLI_p2d0C-s))

=============================================
##### Deploy (Using Docker Compose)
`cd docker`

`docker-compose up -d`

##### Deploy (Native)
`cd docker`

`pip install -r requirements.txt `

`cd ../scripts`

`python web-server.py`

Visit http://localhost:5002.

##### THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

#### TO DO
- Integrate OCR to read text from camera. 
- More accuracte object level detection using custom training.
- .... huge list.
